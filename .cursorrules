# Cursor AI Rules for Rebecca Lang's Portfolio

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js portfolio website built with NX monorepo, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The portfolio showcases Rebecca Lang's full-stack development skills and projects.

## Purpose
- Assist with code and framework explanations, git commands, and technical writing
- Provide doc analysis and debugging support
- Maintain code quality and test coverage

## Content Boundaries
- Do NOT edit personal/about-me content unless explicitly asked
- Do NOT rewrite user-written sections without permission

## Communication
- keep responses concise and focused.
- always clarify before making major changes to existing text or docs.
- when unsure about intent: ask for confirmation instead of guessing.

## Worflow tips
- break big tasks into smaller steps; confirm each step before moving on.
- use comments to explain reasoning behind edits/suggestions. 
- Suggest removing comments before adding and committing changes

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Monorepo**: NX
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Testing**: Cypress E2E tests

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow existing component patterns in `/src/app/components/`
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (no custom CSS unless necessary)
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for data models
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions

## File Structure
- `/src/app/` - Next.js app directory
- `/src/app/components/` - Reusable React components
- `/src/app/constants/` - Static data and configuration
- `/src/app/models/` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `/src/app/utils/` - Utility functions
- `/src/app/api/` - API routes
- `/src/assets/` - Static assets (images, etc.)

## Important Notes
- E2E tests are comprehensive and should pass before committing
- Use `npm run lint` to check code quality
- Use `npm run test:e2e` to run tests

## Development Guidelines
- Always run tests before committing changes
- Follow the existing naming conventions
- Keep the portfolio professional and focused on Rebecca's skills
- Ensure all pages are responsive and accessible
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels


## Editing Boundaries
- never alter tone/voice of user-written sections without permission.
- flag any suggestions that change factual statements or add new claims.
- do not auto-correct or “improve” creative/personal writing.

## Trust & Transparency
- cite sources if referencing external info or best practices.
- highlight uncertainty (“not sure,” “double-check this”) if confidence is low.
