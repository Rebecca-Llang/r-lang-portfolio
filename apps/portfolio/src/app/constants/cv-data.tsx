export const aboutMeContent = `Kia ora! I'm Rebecca, a full-stack software engineer passionate about people and user-focused solutions. I graduated from Dev Academy, gaining hands-on experience across the full stack with modern technologies, Agile practices, and collaborative development. Since then, I've built projects including an e-commerce site, my personal portfolio and AI chatbots, sharpening my skills in frontend and backend development, CI/CD pipelines, and testing.
Warm, curious and enthusiastic, I thrive in collaborative teams and knowledge sharing environments, while also enjoying independent problem-solving. With a background in customer service and management, I bring strong interpersonal skills, adaptability, and a commitment to continuous learning. I'm driven to create software that is accessible, inclusive, and genuinely useful.`;
